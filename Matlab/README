Matlab is used to compute all the algebraic 
identities that come up within universal projective geometry.
I used it to do complex computations using the sym package.
The m.files here are all that's needed for the computations for
finding the quadrangle centroids. I also show the structures of the diagonal
triangles.

You must first load the Quad_Variables_Run_First.m file as it contains the 
set up of the standard quadrangle.
From then you may run the Quad_midpoints.m file but I do run this or provide
the sigma substitute in the Subtri_Medians.m file. After finding the
medains of the subtriangles, the subtriangle centroids can be computed and furthermore
the Quadrangle centroids through the Quad_Cents_Through_Subtr_Cents.m file.
To compute the perspectivities of the diagonal triangles the bimedian lines of the
quadrangle need to be computed first. To find the final representations of the 
the perspectivity equations I recommend computing these values whichout the 
change to sigma value representation. This will give you the final results.

Further exploration into UHG is shown in the exploration folder.

All the tools used here were constructed by me and can be seen in the tools folder.
