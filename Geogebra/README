Universal Projective Geometry is explored through Universal Hyperbolic Geometry and GeoGebra.
To start exploring open the Standard.ggb file, and use the numerous tool. The conic can be changed 
so that general hyperbolic geometry can be explored. I have listed many tools in the tool folder,
and give .ggb files for how I created them. GeoGebra has many resources on how to make tools, if 
further tools are wanted to be made. I also include some .ggb files where some of my exploration
has taken place, these won't make a lot of sense, as they are quite complicated. The graphics folder 
contains all the .ggb files which I used to create the pictures of my thesis. These are quite nice and
could be used as a reference on how to construct your own structures.
